# visualisation-pareto-set
Scripts for visualisation of a Pareto-optimal set
By Stephanie Ashbolt, PhD Candidate, Victoria University

The .ipynb files are the notebooks which contain the code for analysis and plotting. The folders contain outputs of these notebooks.
Most of the data configuration and formatting is done in 'DO FIRST - Data Loading and Processing.ipynb'. The other workbooks then reference the outputs from this set.
Currently, the other notebooks, whilst they should be relatively easily adaptable to other case studies, are set up for 3 objectives only. Also, some of the case study objective and decision variables names need to be changed within these notebooks. 
I hope to amend to make the code more generalisable in the future, so that different case studies and number of objectives can be more easily used.
