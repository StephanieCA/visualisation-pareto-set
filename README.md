Scripts for visualisation of a Pareto-optimal set
By Stephanie Ashbolt, PhD Candidate, Victoria University

Most of the data configuration and formatting is done in 'DO FIRST - Data Loading and Processing'. The other workbooks then reference the outputs from this set.
Currently, the other workbooks, whilst they should be easily adaptable to other case studies, have 'hard-coded' some of the case study objective and decision variables. Also, they currently plot for 3 objectives only.
I hope to amended to make the code more generalisable at a later date, so that different case studies and number of objectives can be used.
